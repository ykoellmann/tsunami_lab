2. Finite Volume Discretization
================================

Implementation
--------------

The one-dimensional finite volume discretization is realized in
``WavePropagation1d``, which manages cell quantities, ghost cells, and
the time-step update. The solver can be switched between Roe and
f-wave at runtime.

``DamBreak1d`` supports independently configurable heights and momenta
on both sides, covering both the classical dam break and the 2.2.2
evacuation scenario. ``ShockShock1d`` and ``RareRare1d`` are symmetric
Riemann setups with antisymmetric momentum. All setups use the
convention :math:`x \leq x_{\text{dis}}` for the left state.

The CLI in ``main.cpp`` selects a setup via ``-p``; domain size and
end time are set via ``-d`` and ``-t``. CSV snapshots are written at
every 0.5% of total time steps, each annotated with a
``# sim_time=...`` header.

The Middle State Sanity Check is implementes as a dedicated Catch2 test case (``[MiddleStates]``).

Unit Tests
----------

Each setup has its own test file (``[DamBreak1d]``,
``[ShockShock1d]``, ``[RareRare1d]``) covering constant heights,
momentum signs, antisymmetry, left-state assignment of the
discontinuity cell, zero y-momentum, and time-independence of the
initial state.
``[MiddleStates]`` reads ``middle_states.csv``, runs the f-wave solver on each listed Riemann problem, and compares the computed middle state height :math:`h^*` against the reference within a relative tolerance of :math:`10^{-3}`.
The solver passes across the full data set.

Results & Visualizations
------------------------

Rare-Rare problem (2.1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Observations
""""""""""""

As the graphics below show, we were able to observe that changing the momentum doesn't affect the speed of the wave.
On the other hand, changing the height does have an effect on the speed.
These observations match the expectations, since mathematically the momentum gets canceled out, while the height directly influences the wave speed through the gravitational term.:

.. math::
  h_r &= h_l\ \land\ hu_r = -hu_l\ \Rightarrow\ u_r = -u_l \\
  h &= \frac{1}{2}(h_l+h_r) = h_l = h_r \\
  u &= \frac{u_l \sqrt{h_l} + u_r \sqrt{h_r}}{\sqrt{h_l}+\sqrt{h_r}} = \frac{u_l \sqrt{h_l} - u_l \sqrt{h_l}}{2\sqrt{h_l}} = 0 \\
  \lambda_{1,2} &= 0 \pm \sqrt{gh}

Shock-Shock problem (2.1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Observations
""""""""""""

Here we were able to observe the same effects as in the rare-rare problem, which is expected since the shock-shock and rare-rare problems are symmetric counterparts with respect to the momentum.
Again, changing the momentum does not affect the wave speed, while changing the height does, due to its influence on the gravitational term in the wave speed calculation.

Dam-Break (2.2.1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Setup
"""""
The dam-break solver is applied with varying initial water heights :math:`h_l` and :math:`h_r`
while keeping the initial momenta at zero (:math:`hu_l = hu_r = 0`).
The dam is placed at the center of the domain.

As the ratio :math:`h_l / h_r` increases, two effects become clearly visible.
First, the shock wave propagating to the right accelerates — the higher the left
water column, the faster the shock front travels. Second, the rarefaction wave on
the left side widens and the water height drops more steeply behind it.
This is consistent with the Roe eigenvalue :math:`\lambda_r^{Roe} = u^{Roe} + \sqrt{g h^{Roe}}`,
where a larger :math:`h^{Roe}` directly increases the shock speed.

Impact of :math:`u_r`
""""""""""""""""""""""
The initial particle velocity :math:`u_r` in the river has a comparatively small
impact on the overall wave structure. Since :math:`u_r` enters the Roe average only
as a weighted contribution,

.. math::

   u^{Roe} = \frac{u_l \sqrt{h_l} + u_r \sqrt{h_r}}{\sqrt{h_l} + \sqrt{h_r}},

its influence on :math:`\lambda_r^{Roe}` is small compared to the gravitational term
:math:`\sqrt{g h^{Roe}}`, which is dominated by the water heights. For the tested
configurations, the shock speed and wave structure are therefore primarily
determined by the ratio :math:`h_l / h_r`.

Village Evacuation Time (2.2.2)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Setup:
""""""
Dam at :math:`x=5000m`, village at :math:`x=30000m`,
:math:`s_{village} = 25000m`. Initial state: :math:`h_l = 14m`,
:math:`h_r = 3.5m`, :math:`hu_l = 0`, :math:`hu_r = 0.7 m^2/s`.
Evacuation time is estimated via the speed of the right-going wave.

Theoretical Estimate:
"""""""""""""""""""""
.. math::

  s_{village} &= 25000m \\\\
  q_l &= \begin{bmatrix} 14 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},\ q_r = \begin{bmatrix} 3.5 \\ 0.7 \end{bmatrix}\\
  u_r &= \frac{hu_r}{h_r} = \frac{0.7}{3.5} = 0.2 \frac{m}{s}\\\\
  h^{Roe} &= \frac{1}{2} (h_l + h_r) = \frac{1}{2} (14 + 3.5) = 8.75 m \\
  u^{Roe} &= \frac{u_l \sqrt{h_l} + u_r \sqrt{h_r}}{\sqrt{h_l}+\sqrt{h_r}} = \frac{0 \cdot \sqrt{14} + 0.2 \cdot \sqrt{3.5}}{\sqrt{14}+\sqrt{3.5}} = 0.06667 \frac{m}{s}\\\\
  \lambda_r^{Roe} &= u^{Roe} + \sqrt{gh^{Roe}} = 0.06667 + \sqrt{9.80665 \cdot 8.75} = 9.32994 \frac{m}{s} \\
  t_{evac} &= \frac{s_{village}}{\lambda_r^{Roe}} = \frac{25000m}{9.32994} = 2679.54 s \approx 44.66 min

Simulation:
""""""""""
Setup: ``./build/tsunami_lab -n 30000 -d 30000 -t 2400 -p DamBreak 14 3.5 5000 0 0.7``.
The shock front reaches the village (:math:`x=30000`) at
:math:`t \approx 2256 s (\sim 37.6 min)`.

.. image:: ../../../simulations/visualizations/evacuation_problem.gif
   :width: 30%
Results:
""""""""

The analytical estimate yields :math:`\sim 44.66 min`, while the
simulation shows the shock arriving :math:`\sim 7 min` earlier at
:math:`\sim 37.6 min`. This is expected, as :math:`\lambda_r^{Roe}`
underestimates the true shock speed because the shock propagates
through water already set in motion by the dam break.
